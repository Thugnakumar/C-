This is the Hash Table project. It allows users to input a first and last name, ID number, and GPA to create a student which is then stored in a node. Those nodes are then pushed into a specific array index; the index is derived by finding the modulus of the ID number and the size of the array. Upon insertion, the program checks to see how many nodes are in that particular array slot (collisions). If there are 3 nodes in that index, then the size of the table is changed and the indices of the nodes are altered according to the size of the table/array.
